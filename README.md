I chose to do the Book Catalogue version of the assignment.

Use Case
	The user is greeted with a minimalist login page with placeholders that read username and password. If the credentials don’t match ones stored in the users table then an error is thrown. Once the user is logged in, there is a search bar powered by Google Book API. The user can search a book by topic, ISBN and author. The book can also be saved to the users profile as well as deleted. In the future I think a reasonable expansion would be a “suggestions” algorithm that may start off by simply displaying a few books of a similar topic underneath a book that any user saves.
